### The zorb companion app! [Click here to launch and get rolling!](https://zorber-gwsbg.ondigitalocean.app/)

#### API repository can be found [here.](https://github.com/gqgonzales/zorber-api) Presentation slides can be found [here.](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1shTjiw1AsMxeDLAlYpR3o19naOmTa7l_Q6UF-xKJDLw/edit?usp=sharing)

For too long, organizing zorb races and meetups has fallen to the indiscretion of our cell phone's group chats. Why isn't there an easier way to organize the world's next outdoor obsession?

NOW THERE IS! Zorber allows users to create new events, edit their finish times, and particpate in the craze that's rolling all over the map. Register with a faux-email (we suggest `yournamehere@nss.com`) or log in as Clark Creswell, one of the founding members `clark@nss.com`: enjoy the freedom to browse upcoming events, make changes, and see who keeps taking home bragging rights each week.

### Features

1. Users can create events, either past and present, and add participants
2. Authors can edit lap times, participants, and more for finished events
3. Users can search through created events to find exactly what they're looking for

### Getting started

#### About authentication....

This application uses mock authentication which is purely for demonstration purposes. Therefore the login an registration code written here is not secure and is not suitable for a professional application.

#### Created by Gabriel Gonzales, with special thanks to Monica Kay, Steve Brownlee, Aja Washington, and Gwynne Meeks.


Zorber was founded on [React.js](https://reactjs.org/), deployed on [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/), styled with elements from [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/), and represents my Front End Web Development capstone project at Nashville Software School. It was built in three weeks (including a planning phase), and my aim was to incorporate full CRUD functionality, gain a deeper understanding of React Hooks and state, and understand the dataflow of JSON Server.

##### Thank you so much for your time and for being a part of the worldwide Zorb family. Roll on ðŸŸ¢
