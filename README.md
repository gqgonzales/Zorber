For too long, organizing zorb races and meetups has fallen to the indiscretion of our phone's group threads. Why isn't there an easier way to organize the world's next obsession?

WELL NOW THERE IS! Zorber allows users to create new events, edit their finish times, and particpate in the craze that's rolling all over the map. Register with a faux-email (we suggest yournamehere@nss.com) or log in as Clark Creswell, one of the founding members (clark@nss.com): enjoy the freedom to browse upcoming events, make changes, and see who keeps on taking home the bragging rights each week.

Zorber was created with react and can be hosted on port 8088. The corresponding API, which can be found [here,](https://github.com/gqgonzales/zorber-api) is best hosted on port 3000.

This app was styled with elements from [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/), built in [React](https://reactjs.org/) and represents my Front End Web Development capstone project from Nashville Software School.

Thank you so much for your time and for being a part of the worldwide Zorb family. Roll on ðŸŸ¢
