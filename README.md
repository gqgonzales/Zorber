# Zorber

### The zorb companion app! [Click here to launch and get rolling!](https://zorber.herokuapp.com/)

#### API repository can be found [here.](https://github.com/gqgonzales/zorber-api) Presentation slides can be found [here.](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1shTjiw1AsMxeDLAlYpR3o19naOmTa7l_Q6UF-xKJDLw/edit?usp=sharing)

For too long, organizing zorb races and meetups has fallen to the indiscretion of our cell phone's group chats. Why isn't there an easier way to organize the world's next outdoor obsession?

NOW THERE IS! Zorber allows users to create new events, edit their finish times, and particpate in the craze that's rolling all over the map. Register with a faux-email (we suggest `yournamehere@nss.com`) or log in as Clark Creswell, one of the founding members `clark@nss.com`: enjoy the freedom to browse upcoming events, make changes, and see who keeps taking home bragging rights each week.

Zorber was created with [React.js](https://reactjs.org/), deployed on [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/), styled with elements from [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/), and represents my Front End Web Development capstone project at Nashville Software School.

<!-- For development purposes, run `json-server -p 8088 -w database.json` in the api directory and `npm start` in the client directory! -->
Thank you so much for your time and for being a part of the worldwide Zorb family. Roll on ðŸŸ¢
